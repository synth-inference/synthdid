# synthdid: Synthetic Difference in Differences Estimation

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/grf-labs/synth-inference/_apis/build/status/synth-inference.synthdid?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/grf-labs/synth-inference/_build/latest?definitionId=4&branchName=master)

This package implements the synthetic difference in difference estimator (SDID) for the average treatment effect in panel data,
as proposed in Arkhangelsky et al (2019). We observe matrices of outcomes Y and binary treatment indicators W
that we think of as satisfying Y<sub>ij</sub> = L<sub>ij</sub> + &tau;<sub>ij</sub> W<sub>ij</sub> + &epsilon;<sub>ij</sub>.
Here &tau;<sub>ij</sub> is the effect of treatment on the unit i at time j, and we estimate the average effect of
treatment when and where it happened: the average of &tau;<sub>ij</sub> over the observations with W<sub>ij</sub>=1.
All treated units must begin treatment simultaneously, so W is a block matrix: W<sub>ij</sub> = 1 for i > N<sub>0</sub> and j > T<sub>0</sub>
and zero otherwise, with N<sub>0</sub> denoting the number of control units and T<sub>0</sub> the number of observation times
before onset of treatment. This applies, in particular, to the case of a single treated unit or treated period.


This package is currently in beta and the functionality and interface is subject to change.

### Installation

The current development version can be installed from source using devtools.

```R
devtools::install_github("synth-inference/synthdid")
```

### Example

```R
library(synthdid)

# Estimate the effect of California Proposition 99 on cigarette consumption
data('california_prop99')
setup = panel.matrices(california_prop99)
tau.hat = synthdid_estimate(setup$Y, setup$N0, setup$T0)
se = sqrt(vcov(tau.hat, method='placebo'))
sprintf('point estimate: %1.2f', tau.hat)
sprintf('95%% CI (%1.2f, %1.2f)', tau.hat - 1.96 * se, tau.hat + 1.96 * se)
plot(tau.hat)
```
