#' @description
#' This package implements the synthetic difference in difference estimator (SDID) for the average treatment effect in panel data,
#' as proposed in Arkhangelsky et al (2019). We observe matrices of outcomes Y and binary treatment indicators W
#' that we think of as satisfying Y\[i,j\] = L\[i,j\] + tau\[i,j\] W\[i,j\] + noise\[i,j\].
#' Here tau\[i,j\] is the effect of treatment on the unit i at time j, and we estimate the average effect of
#' treatment when and where it happened: the average of tau\[i,j\] over the observations with W\[i,j\]=1.
#' All treated units must begin treatment simultaneously, so W is a block matrix: W\[i,j\] = 1 for i > N0 and j > T0
#' and zero otherwise, with N0 denoting the number of control units and T0 the number of observation times
#' before onset of treatment. This applies, in particular, to the case of a single treated unit or treated period.
#'
#' This package is currently in beta and the functionality and interface is subject to change.
